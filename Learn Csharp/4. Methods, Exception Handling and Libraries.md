# 1. Methods and Exception Handling
## Functions

Functions, known as methods, are a significant feature of programming, providing a means to create reusable code. They allow programmers to build modular programs, improving efficiency, readability, and maintainability.
#### Creating a method

In C#, a method declaration specifies the method’s name, return type, and parameters within the class definition. Here's an example of a method declaration for a simple method that multiplies two numbers:

```csharp
public int Multiply(int a, int b) 
{
    return a * b;
}
```

The method is declared `public`, which means it can be accessed from other classes. `int` signifies the return type, indicating that the method will return an integer value. `Multiply` is the method's name, and within the parentheses `(int a, int b)`, we define the parameters the method will take.

The definition of a method involves providing the body of the method or what the method does. The code block inside the curly brackets `{}` forms the method’s body.

The `return` statement specifies the output of the method . In this case, it returns the product of `a` and `b`.

*In C#, the terms "declaration" and "definition" of a method aren't typically differentiated, as they are in some languages such as C/C++. This is because C# does not permit separate declaration and definition of methods - when you declare a method, you must also provide its implementation, thus effectively defining it.*

#### Method Scope

Scope pertains to the visibility or accessibility of variables within the program. In C#, variables declared inside a method, known as local variables, are not accessible outside that method. For instance:

```csharp
public int Multiply(int a, int b) 
{
    int result = a * b;
    return result;
}

public void DisplayResult() 
{
    Console.WriteLine(result); // This will lead to an error
}
```

In the `DisplayResult()` method, accessing the `result` variable local to the `Multiply` method would result in a compile-time error. This is because the `result` is out of scope in `DisplayResult()`.

However, if a variable is declared in a class but outside any method, it is a global variable and can be accessed from any method within that class.

#### Static vs Non-Static Methods

The `static` keyword is used to declare members that `belong to the type` rather than `any instance of the type`. This means that static members are shared across all instances of a type and can be accessed directly using the type name, without creating an instance of the class.

Methods can be declared as `static` or `non-static`, also known as `instance` methods.

Details about `classes` and `instances` will be explored in the `Object-oriented Programming` section, but for now, just note the following.

A `static` method belongs to the class itself rather than any specific class instance. It is declared with the keyword `static`.



```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Static method
    public static void MyStaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a static method.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Call the static method
        MyClass.MyStaticMethod();  // Outputs: This is a static method.
    }
}
```

To call a static method, you don't need to create an instance of the class. Instead, you use the class name itself.



```csharp
MyClass.MyStaticMethod();
```

Since static methods are tied to the class itself, they can only access the class's other static members (methods, properties, etc.). They cannot access non-static members as those belong to specific instances of the class.

A `non-static` (or `instance`) method belongs to a particular class instance. It is declared without using the `static` keyword.



```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Non-static (instance) method
    public void MyInstanceMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is an instance method.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an instance of MyClass
        MyClass myObject = new MyClass();

        // Call the instance method
        myObject.MyInstanceMethod();  // Outputs: This is an instance method.
    }
}
```

To call a non-static method, you must create an instance of the class.



```csharp
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
myObject.MyInstanceMethod();
```

Instance methods can access the class's `static` and `non-static` members since they belong to a specific class instance.

Static members can also include `fields`, `properties`, `events`, `operators`, and `constructors`.

## Exceptions

Exception handling in C# is a robust mechanism used to handle runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. C# provides a structured solution to error handling through try-and-catch blocks. Using these blocks, we can isolate code that may throw an exception and enable the program to respond rather than letting the program crash.

#### try catch finally

A `try` block is used to encapsulate a region of code. If any statement within the try block throws an exception, that exception will be handled by the associated catch block.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that could potentially throw an exception.
}
```

The `catch` block is used to catch and handle an exception. It follows a try block or another catch block. Each try block can have multiple catch blocks associated with it, each designed to handle specific or multiple exceptions. A `catch` block without a specified type will catch all exceptions.

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
```

A `finally` block lets you execute code after a try block has been completed, regardless of whether an exception has been thrown. It is optional and cleans up resources inside the try block (like database connections, files, or network resources).



```csharp
finally
{
    // Code to be executed after the try block has completed,
    // regardless of whether an exception was thrown.
}
```

Here's an example of try, catch, and finally all used together:



```csharp
try
{
    // Code that could potentially throw an exception.
    int divisor = 0;
    int result = 10 / divisor;
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    // Handle the DivideByZeroException.
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero");
}
finally
{
    // Code to be executed after the try block has completed,
    // regardless of whether an exception was thrown.
    Console.WriteLine("This code is always executed.");
}
```

When dealing with `catch blocks`, remember that they can handle multiple exception. The order in which you specify different catch blocks matters; they're examined top to bottom, so the first one that matches the exception type will be executed. If you have a catch block that handles all exceptions at the top, it will catch all exceptions, and none of the catch blocks below it will execute. This is why the catch block for the most general exception type, `Exception`, is usually last.



```csharp
try
{
    // Code that could throw an exception
    int[] arr = new int[5];
    arr[10] = 30; // This line throws an IndexOutOfRangeException.
}
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    // Handle specific exception first
    Console.WriteLine("An IndexOutOfRangeException has been caught: " + ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // General exception catch block
    Console.WriteLine("An exception has been caught: " + ex.Message);
}
```

The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown. If you have any code that must execute, whether an exception is thrown or not, it should be placed in a finally block. For example, if you open a file in a try block, you should close it in a finally block, whether or not an exception is thrown when working with the file.



```csharp
StreamReader reader = null;
try
{
    reader = new StreamReader("file.txt");
    // Code to read the file.
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    // Whether an exception is thrown or not, close the file.
    if (reader != null)
        reader.Close();
}
```

#### throw

The `throw` keyword can be used to raise exceptions. You can throw a pre-existing exception, or you can instantiate a new exception and throw it.

```csharp
try
{
    // Throw a new exception.
    throw new Exception("A problem has occurred.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception.
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

## Practice 

```csharp
try
{
    int[] arr = new int[8];
    arr[11] = 69;
}
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    // Handle specific exception first
    Console.WriteLine("IndexOutOfRangeException: " + ex.Message);
}
```

The output:

```powershell
E:\HTB_Academy\HTB_CWEE_source_code\Intro to C Sharp\Basic_Console_App_2\Basic_Console_App_2\bin\Debug>.\Basic_Console_App_2.exe

IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
```

# 2. Lambda Expressions

A lambda expression is a method without a name that calculates and returns a single value. They are simple methods to represent `anonymous methods` (methods without a name) or `functions` inline.

A lambda expression consists of three main parts: a `parameter list`, the `lambda operator` (`=>`), and an `expression or statement`. The general syntax for a lambda expression looks something like this:

```csharp
(parameters) => expression or statement block
```

- The `parameters` represent the input values to the lambda expression. They can be zero or more, separated by commas. If there is only one parameter, parentheses are optional. For multiple parameters, parentheses are required.
- The `lambda Operator (=>)` separates the parameter list from the body of the expression. It denotes a relationship between the parameters and the code to execute.
- The `expression or statement block` represents the code that is executed when the lambda expression is invoked. For a single expression, the result is implicitly returned. A statement block is enclosed in curly braces `{}` for multiple statements.

Consider the example given in the `LINQ` section.

```csharp
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

The lambda expression `num => num % 2 == 0` specifies the condition for the `Where` method to filter the numbers. Here, `num` is the input parameter, and the condition to the right of the lambda operator is the statement block. This condition is applied to each element of the numbers list.

For each number (`num`) in `numbers`, keep it if the remainder when `num` is divided by 2 equals 0.

The `%` operator is the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of a division operation. Therefore, `num % 2 == 0` checks if a number is evenly divisible by 2, i.e., it's an even number.

### Simple Lambda Expression

Consider the following method.

```csharp
void Greet()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
}

// Invoke the method
Greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
```

In this example, we merely define a method that prints a message to the console when invoked. However, we can further simplify this code using a lambda function, which essentially condenses it into a single line.

```csharp
// Lambda expression without parameters
var greet = () => Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
```

In this instance, we've defined a lambda expression without any parameters. The lambda expression assigns a function to the variable `greet`, which prints "Hello, world!" to the console upon invocation.

While both achieve the same outcome, the lambda expression is far more succinct and can be employed as an inline function where required, contrasted with the method definition that necessitates a separate declaration.

### Lambda Expression with Parameters

A `Lambda Expression with Parameters` is a type of lambda expression in C# that takes one or more input parameters. This type of lambda expression is typically used when you want to perform an operation or evaluate a condition using the input parameters.

```csharp
// Regular method
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

// Lambda expression with parameters
var add = (int a, int b) => a + b;
int result = add(5, 3);
Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 8
```

Here, we define a lambda expression with two parameters `a` and `b`, which adds the values of `a` and `b`. The lambda expression is assigned to the variable `add`, and we invoke it with arguments `5` and `3`, resulting in the sum `8` being assigned to the variable `result`.

### Lambda Expression with Statement Block

A `Lambda Expression with a Statement Block`, often called a `Statement Lambda`, is a type of lambda expression in C# that contains a block of code instead of a single expression on the right side of the lambda operator (`=>`).



```csharp
// Regular method
bool IsEven(int number)
{
    if (number % 2 == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

// Lambda expression with statement block
var isEven = (int number) =>
{
    if (number % 2 == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
};

bool even = isEven(6);
Console.WriteLine(even); // Output: True
```

In this example, we define a lambda expression with a parameter `number` and a statement block enclosed in curly braces. The lambda expression checks if the `number` is even and returns `true` or `false` accordingly. We assign the result of invoking the lambda expression with `6` to the variable `even`, which evaluates to `true`.

# 3. Libraries
C# includes many predefined functions and libraries that developers can use to accomplish various tasks more easily and efficiently. The .NET Framework provides these libraries and includes functionalities for things like file I/O, database access, networking, and much more.

A library in C# is typically provided as a `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library) file. To use the library's functions and classes, you must first reference it in your project. This will be done automatically if the library is installed via a package manager like `nuget`, or if you use a library from within the .NET ecosystem.

The `using` directive then tells the compiler to use a specific namespace in the library. A `namespace` groups related class, structures, and other types under a single name. For instance, the `System` namespace includes fundamental classes and base types that are used in C# programming.

For example, to use the `File` class from the `System.IO` namespace for handling files, you would first need to add `using System.IO;` at the top of your code.

```csharp
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Check if a file exists
        if (File.Exists("test.txt"))
        {
            // Read the content of the file
            string content = File.ReadAllText("test.txt");
            Console.WriteLine(content);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The file does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `File.Exists` is a predefined function from the `System.IO` namespace that checks if a file exists at the provided path and `File.ReadAllText` is another predefined function that reads the entire content of the file as a string. Because `System` is a core library, the compiler will automatically include it.

Similarly, you can use predefined functions from other namespaces and libraries—for instance, the `System.Math` namespace contains mathematical functions such as `Math.Sqrt` for computing the square root of a number, `Math.Pow` for raising a number to a specified power, and `Math.Round` for rounding a number to the nearest integer.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        double num = 9.0;
        double squareRoot = Math.Sqrt(num); 
        Console.WriteLine($"The square root of {num} is {squareRoot}"); // Output: 3

        double baseNum = 2.0;
        double exponent = 3.0;
        double power = Math.Pow(baseNum, exponent);
        Console.WriteLine($"{baseNum} raised to the power of {exponent} is {power}"); // Output: 8

        double toBeRounded = 9.9;
        double rounded = Math.Round(toBeRounded);
        Console.WriteLine($"{toBeRounded} rounded to the nearest integer is {rounded}"); // Output: 10
    }
}
```

As you can see, leveraging the predefined functions and libraries provided by the .NET Framework can achieve complex functionality with less code.

### NuGet

In addition to the standard libraries, C# offers extensive support for using third-party libraries and packages. These can be added to your project through various means, including the [NuGet package manager](https://www.nuget.org/). `NuGet` is a free and open-source package manager designed for the Microsoft development platform, and it hosts thousands of libraries.

Adding a `NuGet` package to your project can be as easy as right-clicking on your project in the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, selecting "`Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...`" and then searching for and installing the required package. 

*If using a code editor, use the `dotnet package add` command, but [Microsoft provides great documentation for using nuget from the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-za/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-dotnet-cli).*

![[Pasted image 20240520233959.png]]

Once a package is installed, you can utilise its functionality in your code by adding the appropriate `using` directive at the top of your file. The `Newtonsoft.Json` package, for instance, provides powerful tools for working with JSON data.



```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string json = "[{'Name':'John', 'Age':30}, {'Name':'Jane', 'Age':28}]";

        List<Person> people = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Person>>(json);

        foreach (var person in people)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.Name}, Age: {person.Age}");
        }
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>` method is used to parse the JSON string into a list of `Person` objects. This predefined function, part of the `Newtonsoft.Json` library, dramatically simplifies the task of JSON parsing.

```powershell
E:\HTB_Academy\HTB_CWEE_source_code\Intro to C Sharp\Basic_Console_App_2\Basic_Console_App_2\bin\Debug>.\Basic_Console_App_2.exe

Name: John, Age: 30
Name: Jane, Age: 28
```

### Manual Referencing

It is also possible to manually link a library to the project. If you use an IDE such as Visual Studio, or Jetbrains Rider, it's as simple as right-clicking on the `Project Dependencies` section under the *Solution Explorer* and selecting the `Add Project Reference...` option, and then finding the library you want to link.

Alternatively, if you are using a Code editor, such as VSCode, you will need to manually edit the project file to include the references, such as the example below, which is going to reference every `.dll` file in the libs subfolder:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- references look like this -->
    <Reference Include="libs\*.dll" /> 
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

It's also possible to hardcode paths and establish multiple `Reference` definitions for each individualreference specifically.

To identify the `namespaces`, `types`, `classes`, and `methods` provided by the library, it is generally considered best practice to consult the provided documentation. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code will provide code auto-complete functionality for the functionality from imported libraries through their IntelliSense auto-complete tool.

While the .NET Framework and third-party libraries offer a wide array of predefined functions, it's essential to understand their usage and potential impact on your application. Some libraries may have licensing restrictions, or they may not be maintained actively. Always research before including a third-party library in your project.

## Pratice

Chúng ta cần phải add thủ công, các thư viện DLL vào `libs` directory - `csharp.csproj` file

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <Reference Include="libs\*.dll" /> 
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

To take the flag, we need to use the library `HTTBLibrary` and print the result of function `Flag.GetFlag()`. This is a basic C# to do this

```csharp
// Program.cs

using HTBLibrary;

string flag = Flag.GetFlag();
Console.WriteLine(flag);

// Output: HTB{L1br4ry_FL4g}
```
