# Object-Oriented Programming
---

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of "objects". Objects are instances of classes, which can contain data in the form of fields, often known as attributes, and code, in the form of methods. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

There are four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming:

1. `Encapsulation` is the practice of keeping fields within a class private and providing access to them via public methods. It's a protective barrier that keeps the data and implementation code bundled together within an object.
2. `Inheritance` is a process by which one class can acquire the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
3. `Polymorphism` enables methods to be used as if they were the methods of a class's parent. It's the characteristic of an operation to behave differently based on the types of objects or arguments involved.
4. `Abstraction` represents essential features without including background details or explanations. It provides a simple interface and reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details.

## Classes & Structs

In C#, a `class` is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. Class definitions start with the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class and typically encapsulate data and methods that operate on that data.

Classes are made up of two fundamental elements: `Properties` and `Methods`.

- `Properties` represent data about the class. They are often referred to as attributes or characteristics. For example, in a `Car` class, properties might include `Color`, `Model`, and `Year`.
- `Methods` represent actions or behaviour associated with the class. They are functions defined within a class. For instance, a `Car` class may have methods like `Drive()`, `Park()`, and `Brake()`.



```csharp
class Car
{
    // Properties
    public string Color;
    public int Year;

    // Method
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The {Color} car from {Year} is driving.");
    }
}
```

In the above example, `Car` is a class that contains two properties (`Color` and `Year`) and one method (`Drive`).

To create an object in C#, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class name. This process is often called `instantiation` because you create an "instance" of a class.



```csharp
Car myCar = new Car();
```

In this line, `myCar` is an object of the `Car` class. You can now use the dot operator `.` to access its properties and methods:



```csharp
myCar.Color = "Red";
myCar.Year = 2020;
myCar.Drive();
// output: The Red car from 2020 is driving.
```

Remember that each object has its own copy of properties. Thus, if you create another `Car` object, it will have its own `Color` and `Year`:



```csharp
Car anotherCar = new Car();
anotherCar.Color = "Blue";
anotherCar.Year = 2021;
//output: The Blue car from 2021 is driving.
```

So even though `myCar` and `anotherCar` are both instances of the `Car` class, they have different property values. This allows objects to have unique states while sharing common behaviour from their respective classes.

Classes can also have a `constructor`, which is a special method in a class or struct that is automatically called when an object of that class or struct is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialise the object and its data members.

The constructor has the same name as the class or struct, and it doesn't have any return type, not even void. It can take parameters if needed.



```csharp
class Car
{
    // Properties
    public string Color;
    public int Year;
    
    // Constructor
    public Car(string c, int y)
    {
        Color = c;
        Year = y;
    }

    // Method
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The {Color} car from {Year} is driving.");
    }
}
```

You can then pass the parameters when the object is instantiated to set the variables.



```csharp
Car myNewCar = new Car("Pink", 2022);
myNewCar.Drive();
// output: The Pink car from 2022 is driving.
```

#### Accessors

An `accessor` is a class member function that provides access to the value of private or protected data members. There are two types of accessors - `get` and `set`.

The `get` accessor is used to return the property value. It provides read-only access to the attribute it is assigned to. If only a `get` accessor is specified, the property becomes read-only.



```csharp
class Circle
{
    private double radius;

    public double Radius
    {
        get
        {
            return radius;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Radius` property has only a `get` accessor, making it read-only. Trying to set its value will result in a compile-time error.

The `set` accessor is used to set the property `value`. It provides write-only access to the attribute it is assigned to. If only a `set` accessor is specified, the property becomes write-only.



```csharp
class Circle
{
    private double radius;

    public double Radius
    {
        set
        {
            if (value > 0)
                radius = value;
            else
                Console.WriteLine("Radius cannot be negative or zero");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Radius` property has only a `set` accessor. Its value can be set but not directly retrieved. The `value` keyword in C# is a special keyword that is used in the `set` accessor of a property or indexer. It represents the new value the code attempts to assign to the property.

Most commonly, you'll see both `get` and `set` accessors used together. This allows for both reading and writing the property value.



```csharp
class Circle
{
    private double radius;

    public double Radius
    {
        get
        {
            return radius;
        }
        set
        {
            if (value > 0)
                radius = value;
            else
                Console.WriteLine("Radius cannot be negative or zero");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Automatic Properties

In C#, an automatic property, also known as auto-implemented property, allows you to define a class property in a concise way without explicitly declaring a backing field. A backing field is a private variable used to store a propertyâ€™s data.

For example, consider a `full property` with a declared backing field:



```csharp
class Circle
{
    private double radius;

    public double Radius
    {
        get
        {
            return radius;
        }
        set
        {
            radius = value;
        }
    }
}
```

Whereas an automatic property will automatically declare the backing field:



```csharp
class Circle
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, `Radius` is an automatic property. The `{ get; set; }` syntax tells C# to generate a hidden backing field behind the scenes automatically. This field stores the actual data, and the `get` and `set` accessors are used to read from and write to this field.

Functionally both properties are identical.



```csharp
Circle c = new Circle();
c.Radius = 12345.54321;

Console.WriteLine(c.Radius);  // Outputs: 12345.54321
```

Automatic properties provide a shorter and more readable way to create properties, helping keep your code clean and efficient.

#### Structs

A `struct`, short for structure, is a value type in C#. This means when a `struct` is created, the variable to which the struct is assigned holds the struct's actual data. This contrasts with reference types, where the variable references the object's data, not the actual data itself.

Structs are useful for small data structures that have value semantics. They can contain fields, methods, and constructors just like classes, but there are some differences:

- Structs do not support inheritance, while classes do. However, both structs and classes can implement interfaces.
- Structs are instantiated without using the `new` keyword, and their constructors are called automatically.
- A struct cannot be `null`, as it's a value type. A class can be `null` because it's a reference type.



```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}
```

In this example, `Point` is a struct that represents a point in two-dimensional space. It includes two properties (`X` and `Y`) and a constructor that initialises those properties.

## 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is often described as the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. It serves as a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed directly by outside code, hence enforcing data integrity and ensuring security.

In C#, data encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers, which control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. The key access modifiers are `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal`.

- A `public` member is accessible from any code in the program.
- A `private` member is only accessible within its own class. This is the most restrictive level of access.
- A `protected` member is accessible within its own class and by derived class instances.
- An `internal` member is accessible only within files in the same assembly.

The convention in C# is to make data members `private` to hide them from other classes (this is known as data hiding). Then, `public` methods known as getters and setters (or, more commonly, properties) are provided to get and set the values of the private fields. These methods serve as the interface to the outside world and protect the data from incorrect or inappropriate manipulation.



```csharp
public class Employee
{
    // Private member data (fields)
    private string name;
    private int age;

    // Public getter and setter methods (properties)
    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }

    public int Age
    {
        get { return age; }
        set 
        { 
            if(value > 0)
                age = value; 
            else 
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid age value");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Employee` class encapsulates the `name` and `age` fields. These fields are `private`, so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the `Employee` class. Instead, access is provided through the `public` properties `Name` and `Age`, which serve as the interface to the `Employee` class. Notice that the `Age` setter includes validation logic to ensure an invalid age cannot be set. This is an excellent example of encapsulation protecting the data in an object. The data (in this case, the `age`) is safeguarded and encapsulated within the `Employee` class.

## 2. Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows for the creation of hierarchical classifications of objects. It offers a mechanism where a new class can inherit members (fields, methods, etc.) of an existing class, thereby promoting code reusability and logical classification.

There are two types of inheritance: single inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

#### Single Inheritance

In single inheritance, a class (aka a derived or child class) inherits from a single-parent class (also known as a base or superclass). This allows the derived class to reuse (or inherit) the fields and methods of the base class, as well as to introduce new ones.

Consider an example where we have a base class, `Vehicle`, and a derived class, `Car`.



```csharp
public class Vehicle {
    public string color;
    
    public void Start() {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle started");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle {
    public string model;
    
    public void Drive() {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving car");
    }
}
```

`Car` is a derived class that inherits from the `Vehicle` base class. It inherits the `color` field and the `Start()` method from `Vehicle` and also defines an additional field `model` and a method `Drive()`.

#### Multilevel Inheritance

Multilevel inheritance is a scenario where a derived class inherits from another. This creates a "chain" of inheritance where a class can inherit members from multiple levels up its inheritance hierarchy.

Let's extend the previous example to include a `SportsCar` class inherited from `Car`.



```csharp
public class SportsCar : Car {
    public int topSpeed;
    
    public void TurboBoost() {
        Console.WriteLine("Turbo boost activated");
    }
}
```

In this case, `SportsCar` is a derived class that inherits from the `Car` class, which in turn inherits from the `Vehicle` class. This means that `SportsCar` has access to the `color` field and `Start()` method from `Vehicle`, the `model` field and `Drive()` method from `Car`, and also defines its own field `topSpeed` and method `TurboBoost()`.

Remember that C# doesn't support multiple inheritance, meaning a class cannot directly inherit from more than one class at the same level. However, as we've seen here, it supports multiple levels of inheritance and allows a class to implement multiple interfaces.

#### base

In C#, the `base` keyword is used to access base class members from within a derived class. This can include methods, properties, and fields of the base class. Furthermore, the `base` keyword is most commonly employed within the derived class's constructor to call the base classâ€™s constructor.

To delve deeper, let's examine the use of the `base` keyword in a few examples. Consider a base-class `Vehicle` and a derived-class `Car`.



```csharp
public class Vehicle
{
    public string Color { get; }

    public Vehicle(string color)
    {
        this.Color = color;
    }

    public void DisplayColor()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Color: {this.Color}");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public string Brand { get; }

    public Car(string color, string brand) : base(color)
    {
        this.Brand = brand;
    }

    public void DisplayCarInformation()
    {
        base.DisplayColor();
        Console.WriteLine($"Brand: {this.Brand}");
    }
}
```

In the derived class `Car`, the `base` keyword is used in two distinct ways:

1. `Constructor`: Within the constructor of `Car`, `base(color)` is used to call the constructor of the base class `Vehicle`. Here, `base` allows `Car` to initialise the `Color` property defined in `Vehicle`.
2. `Methods`: Within the `DisplayCarInformation` method of `Car`, `base.DisplayColor()` is used to call the `DisplayColor` method from the base class `Vehicle`.

The `base` keyword hence provides an effective way to interact with the base class and utilise its members, enabling the principles of reuse and abstraction that are foundational to object-oriented programming. This leads to more manageable, scalable, and organised code.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Abstraction. The term originates from the Greek words "poly," meaning many, and "morph," meaning forms. Thus, polymorphism is the ability of an entity to take on many forms.

In C#, polymorphism is generally realised through method overloading and overriding.

#### Method Overloading

Method overloading, also known as static or compile-time polymorphism, is a technique that allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (in terms of number, type, or order) to coexist within a class.



```csharp
public class Mathematics
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In the above class `Mathematics`, the method `Add` is overloaded: one version of the `Add` method accepts two integers, while the other accepts two doubles. The correct version of the method is selected at compile time-based on the arguments supplied.

#### Method Overriding

Method overriding, on the other hand, is a form of dynamic or run-time polymorphism. It allows a derived class to provide a different implementation for a method already defined in its base class or one of its base classes. The method in the base class must be marked with the `virtual` keyword, and the method in the derived class must use the `override` keyword.



```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Dog` class overrides the `MakeSound` method of the `Animal` class. When `MakeSound` is called on an object of type `Dog`, the overridden version in the `Dog` class is executed.

The concepts of overloading and overriding extend to operators and properties, adding flexibility and expressiveness to C# programming.

#### Operator Overloading

Just like methods, C# allows operators to be overloaded. This enables custom types to be manipulated using standard operators, enhancing code readability and intuitiveness. For example, for a `Vector` class representing a mathematical vector, you might overload the '+' operator to perform vector addition:



```csharp
public class Vector
{
    public double X { get; set; }
    public double Y { get; set; }

    public Vector(double x, double y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public static Vector operator +(Vector v1, Vector v2)
    {
        return new Vector(v1.X + v2.X, v1.Y + v2.Y);
    }
}
```

In this example, instances of `Vector` can be added using the `+` operator, just like primitive types:



```csharp
Vector v1 = new Vector(1, 2);
Vector v2 = new Vector(3, 4);
Vector sum = v1 + v2;  // { X = 4, Y = 6 }
```

#### Property Overriding

In C#, properties, like methods, can be overridden in derived classes. A base class declares a virtual property, and derived classes can override this property to change its behaviour.



```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }

    public Animal(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public Dog(string name) : base(name) { }

    public override string Name
    {
        get { return base.Name; }
        set { base.Name = value + " the dog"; }
    }
}
```

In this case, a `Dog` object modifies the behaviour of the `Name` property to append " the dog" to any name assigned to it:



```csharp
Dog myDog = new Dog("Rex");
Console.WriteLine(myDog.Name);  // "Rex the dog"
```

These examples underline the power of polymorphism in C# and object-oriented programming. It allows classes to provide tailored implementations of methods, operators, and properties, enabling more natural, expressive, and aligned code with the problem domain.

## 4. Abstraction

In object-oriented programming, abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex reality by modelling classes appropriate to the problem and working at the most appropriate level of inheritance for a given aspect of the problem. It is a mechanism that represents the essential features without including the background details.

Abstraction in C# is achieved by using `abstract` classes and `interfaces`. An `abstract` class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base class for other classes. `Abstract` classes can have `abstract` methods which are declared in the `abstract` class and implemented in the derived classes.



```csharp
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void Speak();
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat meows");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `Speak`. `Dog` and `Cat` classes are derived from `Animal` and provide their own implementation of `Speak`. When `Speak` is called on an object of type `Animal`, the appropriate version of `Speak` is invoked depending on the actual type of the object.

Abstraction using `Interfaces` is another way to achieve abstraction. An `interface` is like an `abstract` class with no implementation. It only declares the methods and properties but doesn't contain any code. A class that implements an interface must provide an implementation for all the interface methods.



```csharp
public interface IAnimal
{
    void Speak();
}

public class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks");
    }
}

public class Cat : IAnimal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat meows");
    }
}
```

In this example, `IAnimal` is an interface with a method `Speak`. The classes `Dog` and `Cat` both implement `IAnimal` and provide their own implementation of `Speak`.

In both examples, the user does not need to understand how each animal speaks; they only need to know that all animals can speak. This is the essence of abstraction. It allows you to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Abstraction has several benefits in software development:

1. `Complexity Management`: It simplifies the complexity of designing and maintaining large codebases. By creating abstract classes or interfaces, developers can develop methods and variables that apply to a broad range of related classes. It's easier to manage and understand a few abstract concepts than a larger number of detailed ones.
    
2. `Reusability`: The use of abstraction promotes the reuse of code. Abstract classes and interfaces often create a template for future classes. Implementing these templates ensures consistent method use across classes and can reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
    
3. `Security`: Using abstraction, certain details of an object's implementation can be hidden from the user. This can prevent unauthorised or inappropriate use of an object's methods or variables.
    
4. `Flexibility`: Abstraction provides a level of flexibility in the development process. As long as the interface between objects remains consistent, changes to the internal workings of an object do not affect the rest of the application. This allows for more freedom in future development and refactoring efforts.
    

In addition to abstract classes and interfaces, encapsulation is another way to achieve abstraction in C#. Encapsulation refers to bundling data and the methods of operating it into a single unit. This is typically accomplished by defining a class. The data is stored in private fields, and accessed through public methods, protecting the data from being altered in unexpected ways.

For example, consider a `BankAccount` class:



```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private double balance;

    public void Deposit(double amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(double amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    public double GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `balance` field is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, it is accessed through the `Deposit`, `Withdraw`, and `GetBalance` methods, which ensure the balance cannot be set to an invalid state. This is an example of encapsulation providing abstraction, as users of the `BankAccount` class do not need to know how the balance is stored or how the methods are implemented; they only need to know what methods are available to use.

# Generics

---

Generics are a feature in C# that let you write type-safe and performant code that works with any data type. Without generics, developers often have to write separate versions of algorithms for different data types or resort to less type-safe options like casting to and from objects.

A type is a description of a set of data that specifies the kind of data that can be stored, the operations that can be performed on that data, and how the data is stored in memory. In C#, types are used extensively to ensure that code behaves as expected, i.e., a `string` can't be directly assigned to an `int` variable.

Generics extend this idea of types to type parameters. A generic type is a class, struct, interface, delegate, or method with a placeholder for one or more types it operates on. The actual types used by a generic type are specified when you create an instance of the type.

### Benefits of Generics

1. `Type safety`: Generics enforce compile-time type checking. They can carry out strongly typed methods, classes, interfaces, and delegates. With generics, you can create type-safe collection classes at compile time.
2. `Performance`: With generics, performance is improved as boxing and unboxing are eliminated. For value types, this can represent a significant performance boost.
3. `Code reusability`: Generics promote reusability. You can create a generic class that can be used with any data type.

### Generic Classes

A generic class declaration looks much like a non-generic class declaration, except that a type parameter list inside angle brackets follows the class name. The type parameters can then be used in the body of the class as placeholders for the types specified when the class is instantiated.



```csharp
public class GenericList<T>
{
    private T[] elements;
    private int count = 0;

    public GenericList(int size)
    {
        elements = new T[size];
    }

    public void Add(T value)
    {
        elements[count] = value;
        count++;
    }

    public T GetElement(int index)
    {
        return elements[index];
    }
}
```

In the above example, `T` is the type parameter. This `GenericList` class can be instantiated with any type.



```csharp
var list1 = new GenericList<int>(10);
var list2 = new GenericList<string>(5);
```

### Generic Methods

Generic methods are methods that are declared with type parameters. Like generic classes, you can create a method that defers the specification of one or more types until the method is called.



```csharp
public class Utilities
{
    public T Max<T>(T a, T b) where T : IComparable
    {
        return a.CompareTo(b) > 0 ? a : b;
    }
}
```

In the `Max` method above, `T` represents any type that implements `IComparable`. This method can now be used with any comparable types, like integers, floats, strings, etc.



```csharp
var utility = new Utilities();
int max = utility.Max<int>(3, 4); // returns 4
```

### Generic Constraints

You may want to restrict the types allowed as type arguments when designing generic classes or methods. For example, you might want to ensure that your generic method only operates on value types or classes, types that implement a particular interface, or types with a default constructor. This is done using generic constraints, which you can specify with the `where` keyword.



```csharp
public class Utilities<T> where T : IComparable, new()
{
    public T Max(T a, T b)
    {
        return a.CompareTo(b) > 0 ? a : b;
    }

    public T Init()
    {
        return new T();
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Utilities` class has two constraints: `T` must implement `IComparable` and `T` must have a default constructor. Now, `Utilities` can be used with any type that satisfies these constraints.



```csharp
var utility = new Utilities<int>();
int max = utility.Max(3, 4); // returns 4
int zero = utility.Init(); // returns 0
```
